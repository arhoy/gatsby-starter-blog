# My Udemy Course Transcription

<div className = "post__p">

Here is my Udemy Journey over the last 3 years. I have taken these courses while working full time and still having other hobbies and it has helped me transition from to a new career a a web developer and soon to be ( hopefully ) full stack developer.

I am sure I will be consistently updating this, as over only about 4 years ago
I was still using notepad++ when I started my development journey. Now having
some of these newer VS Code extensions seems like a necessity rather than nice
to haves and there is always better and newer tools coming out every day. This
setup will be biased toward developers in REACT. I am MERN stack orientated so
if that applies to you here is my setup. Feel free to tell me ones I missed!

Hello Gatsby Universe! I am absolutely estatic to start this brand new blog. This is something I have wanted to do for a quite some time, but I felt my skills in development were not there yet. However, if I think this way I will never start a blog because there is always something new to learn and improve on. I am starting this blog to document my development journey and the skills, tools, libraries and aha moments I have learned and discovered along the way. If no one else but me read this, than at least I can look back at what I have done and kinda go "That is how to do that again!"
